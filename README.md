In this project, we aimed to design a deep learning model based on the ResNet architecture to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Our findings indicate that the model achieves a test accuracy of 91\%, with a total of 778,538 parameters in the model. 

## Code

To run the code, simply open the `dl_miniproject.ipynb` file in the `code` folder with Jupyter Notebook.

## Results

We have designed and compared three ResNet models. Loss curves are shown below.
